A common use case of AWS API Gateway is to create HTTP endpoints which expose functions deploy to AWS Lambda.

Let's create an endpoint which exposes the Micronaut function we deployed to AWS Lambda.

Create a new AWS Gateway API

Create a POST method, with integration type `Lambda Function` and enter the Lambda function name you used.

Create a Model for the incoming request to the method.

Edit the POST Method request and configure the Model as the content type.

You will be able to test the API method and its integration with the AWS Lambda function.

Deploy the API to create an endpoint which we can invoke with an HTTP request:
