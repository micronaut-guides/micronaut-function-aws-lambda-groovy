Micronaut's validation is built on with the standard framework â€“ JSR 380, also known as Bean Validation 2.0.

Hibernate Validator is a reference implementation of the validation API. Starting with Micronaut 1.2, Micronaut
https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#beanValidation[has built-in support for validation beans] that
are annotated with `javax.validation` annotations.

Add the next snippet to `build.gradle`

<1> The class is defined as a controller with the `@Controller` annotation mapped to the path `/invoice`.
<2> Constructor injection of a configuration property.
<3> Constructor injection of a bean.
<4> The `@Post` annotation is used to map the `calculateVat` method to all requests to `/invoice/vat` that use an HTTP POST.
<5> Add `@Valid` to any method parameter which requires validation. Use a POGO supplied as a JSON payload in the request to populate the invoice.
<6> This invokes the function in AWS Lambda.
